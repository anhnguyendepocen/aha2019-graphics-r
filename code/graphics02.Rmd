This lab is much more open-ended. Select one (or more!) of the following
datasets from the **historydata** package:

```{r}
early_colleges <- as_data_frame(early_colleges)
```

```{r}
catholic_dioceses <- as_data_frame(catholic_dioceses)
```

```{r}
naval_promotions <- as_data_frame(naval_promotions)
```

```{r}
tudors <- as_data_frame(tudors)
```

Now, construct 1-2 interesting data visualizations. Build them up slowly by
constructing layers, adding annotations, and labelling the axes. If we have
time, we'll share these as a group.

```{r}





```
